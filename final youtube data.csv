I remember when I started my career, even I wasn‚Äôt entirely clear about the distinction. Back then, I thought both were just fancy terms for working with data, but I quickly realized how different the roles are and how much each contributes uniquely to solving problems.

This video is such a fantastic breakdown of these two disciplines. I loved how it highlighted that data analytics focuses on finding insights and answering specific questions, while data science is about building models and uncovering patterns for predictive insights. It‚Äôs a nuanced distinction that can be confusing, especially for newcomers, but this explanation really hit the mark.

For me, it was during my first project in data science that the difference truly clicked. I was building a machine learning model to predict customer churn while my colleague, an analyst, was digging into the historical data to understand why churn was happening in the first place. Both tasks were critical, but they required completely different approaches, tools, and ways of thinking. This kind of collaboration is what makes the data world so fascinating to me.

To anyone watching this video and trying to decide between these paths: think about whether you enjoy diving deep into datasets to find actionable insights (data analytics) or if you‚Äôd rather experiment with algorithms, code, and predictive models (data science). Either way, both fields are incredibly rewarding, and videos like this are great for helping you find your direction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcXqhMqhZUo

  - Data science and data analytics are often confused but serve different purposes.
  - Data science encompasses tasks like data mining, machine learning model training, and AI deployment.
  - Data analytics is a specialized field within data science focusing on querying, interpreting, and visualizing datasets.

- [00:01:47] üîÑ Data Science Lifecycle

  - The data science lifecycle consists of seven phases: problem identification, data mining, data cleaning, data exploration analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and data visualization.
  - It's an iterative process where hypotheses are formed and tested with data.
  - Essential skills for data scientists include proficiency in Python, R, big data platforms (like Hadoop or Apache Spark), and SQL.

- [00:03:30] üìà Types of Data Analytics

  - Data analytics involves various types: predictive, prescriptive, diagnostic, and descriptive analytics.
  - Predictive analytics forecasts trends and outcomes, while prescriptive analytics provides decision recommendations.
  - Diagnostic analytics identifies causes of events, and descriptive analytics evaluates data qualities and quantities.

- [00:05:16] üßÆ Skills for Data Analysts

  - Data analysts focus on interpreting existing data to derive actionable insights.
  - Skills required include analytical thinking, programming (especially in statistical tools), database familiarity, and data visualization.
  - Unlike data scientists, data analysts are less involved in creating new algorithms but rather in interpreting and applying data findings effectively.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcXqhMqhZUo

Let‚Äôs check and see! Have you ever stolen? (Even if it‚Äôs something really small or not worth much) Have you ever lied? Or have you ever looked with lust ? Now,  have you ever taken the Lords Name in vain? Have you ever hated someone?If you‚Äôve ever done any of those things, you would be either a liar, a thief, an adulterer,(for looking with lust. See Matthew 5:28), a blasphemer(for taking Gods Name in vain), a murderer (for hating someone. See 1 John 3:15) or maybe even all of them. And that was only 5 of the Ten Commandments. Therefore Gods Standard Is Very High. The Bible Even Says That If We‚Äôve Just Broken One Law We‚Äôre Guilty Of Breaking Them All. (James 2:10) So we have all sinned against God and  therefore deserve death.(Romans 3:23 & 6:23)That‚Äôs why A Savior Was SSent; Jesus Christ, to die for the sins of The World And Then He Rose On The 3rd Day . Through His sacrifice He Paid The Fine for our sins, and made Atonement for the sins Of The World. Now we can be made new by accepting The Gift of Salvation. In order to accept This Gift,  we must first Repent. This is a change of mind about sin  (from an embrace of sin to rejection of sin) and a Turning to God. 
Once you Repent, you can then turn to FAITH/TRUST in the Savior. A person who has truly Repented of their sin and has Trust in Christ will give evidence of a changed life. Therefore, as a Result of Salvation you‚Äôll then produce Good Works and the Fruit of Salvation. (Reading the Word, Acts of Kindness, readiness to help, to serve, to give of oneself, The Fruits of the Spirit, etc.) You aren‚Äôt Saved by doing Good Works, but you can then produce Good Works once you are Saved!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EhRT2mOXm8

Also what about a finer or more subtle and nuanced consideration of smaller components on this problem. I saw at least two subcomponents. 1) Identify spam bot accounts. 2) Identify spam posts.

This differentiation is important. Not all spam posts are from spam bot accounts. And which was the goal? Was it to purge spam bot accts or to manage spam posts, or both?

lastly, what about front end implementation? What types of tools can the data science team that can help non-data scientists inspect specific posts? Or specific accounts? Huge opportunity to create user friend with tools that will help manage for example ... what about a tool that lets community manager click on a specific post and then see a dashboard of statistics and information about that post and about its account?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD468LfeVdc

Not just with reCaptcha-style and two-factor requirements but live-post monitoring and throttling as no human should need to post content more than 5 times per hour (imo).  As a data scientist this would have struck much quicker at solving the problem and perhaps mitigate the spam bot problem adequately to not need to implement this reactive solution in the first place.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD468LfeVdc

I remember when I started my career, even I wasn‚Äôt entirely clear about the distinction. Back then, I thought both were just fancy terms for working with data, but I quickly realized how different the roles are and how much each contributes uniquely to solving problems.

This video is such a fantastic breakdown of these two disciplines. I loved how it highlighted that data analytics focuses on finding insights and answering specific questions, while data science is about building models and uncovering patterns for predictive insights. It‚Äôs a nuanced distinction that can be confusing, especially for newcomers, but this explanation really hit the mark.

For me, it was during my first project in data science that the difference truly clicked. I was building a machine learning model to predict customer churn while my colleague, an analyst, was digging into the historical data to understand why churn was happening in the first place. Both tasks were critical, but they required completely different approaches, tools, and ways of thinking. This kind of collaboration is what makes the data world so fascinating to me.

To anyone watching this video and trying to decide between these paths: think about whether you enjoy diving deep into datasets to find actionable insights (data analytics) or if you‚Äôd rather experiment with algorithms, code, and predictive models (data science). Either way, both fields are incredibly rewarding, and videos like this are great for helping you find your direction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcXqhMqhZUo

  - Data science and data analytics are often confused but serve different purposes.
  - Data science encompasses tasks like data mining, machine learning model training, and AI deployment.
  - Data analytics is a specialized field within data science focusing on querying, interpreting, and visualizing datasets.

- [00:01:47] üîÑ Data Science Lifecycle

  - The data science lifecycle consists of seven phases: problem identification, data mining, data cleaning, data exploration analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and data visualization.
  - It's an iterative process where hypotheses are formed and tested with data.
  - Essential skills for data scientists include proficiency in Python, R, big data platforms (like Hadoop or Apache Spark), and SQL.

- [00:03:30] üìà Types of Data Analytics

  - Data analytics involves various types: predictive, prescriptive, diagnostic, and descriptive analytics.
  - Predictive analytics forecasts trends and outcomes, while prescriptive analytics provides decision recommendations.
  - Diagnostic analytics identifies causes of events, and descriptive analytics evaluates data qualities and quantities.

- [00:05:16] üßÆ Skills for Data Analysts

  - Data analysts focus on interpreting existing data to derive actionable insights.
  - Skills required include analytical thinking, programming (especially in statistical tools), database familiarity, and data visualization.
  - Unlike data scientists, data analysts are less involved in creating new algorithms but rather in interpreting and applying data findings effectively.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcXqhMqhZUo

üëáBelow are some troubleshooting steps for a common issue students have encountered:

Windows Users - Conda Virtual Environment Issues (Required Steps for Windows Users):

Background: By default, the terminal in VS Code on Windows, PowerShell, has a restricted execution policy. This is fancy talk for saying that certain scripts and programs are blocked from running for security concerns, with ""conda"" commands being one of them. There are two workarounds for this:
1. Switch from using PowerShell to Command Prompt (Easy)
2. Update PowerShell settings to allow 'conda' commands (Hard)

Option 1: Switch from Powershell to Command Prompt
1. Open the Command Palette: Press Ctrl + Shift + P to open it.
2. In the Command Palette, type `Terminal: Select Default Profile` and press Enter.
3. A list of available terminal profiles will appear. Select `Command Prompt` from the list.

Option 2: Update PowerShell Settings:
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator (Go to Search Bar, Type ""PowerShell,"" Select option ""Run as Administrator"")
2. Check your current execution policy by running the following in the PowerShell terminal:
Get-ExecutionPolicy
3. If set to ""Restricted,"" run the following to change to a good balance of security and functionality:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
4. Run the following to fully setup conda to be run within PowerShell:
conda init powershell

I am a teacher trying to transition into something else. I am currently working on a PhD in educational research and statistics. There are a lot of opportunities in that job market and it typically takes a PhD to fill those roles or someone with a master‚Äôs (If I wanted to do institutional research or something along those lines). I am only halfway through this program, and I don‚Äôt want to continue waiting so I am working towards being a data analyst. Based on my degree path I have some statistical skills, but the programs my university uses is not the same as many data analyst companies. My university uses Excel, Jasp, IBM SPSS, and some individuals know STATA (I just started learning STATA last semester in a course where the instructor chooses everything that goes on in the course. He felt the need because many places are hiring people who know statistical programs that are code instead of point and click). Some of my professors and the department are debating if it is smart to switch over to R (The reason they don‚Äôt is because it would change the how the whole course is outlined to books needed for the course, and teaching code instead of by click for the analysis). Long story short I found out my university partners with coursera and I decided to take the google data analyst certificate in addition to my coursework at school. I plan to take the advanced certificate and the IBM one and hopefully I can land a role. Hopefully by doing this, performing projects, and changing my resume, I can hopefully get a new job by June or July.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVa0Wy96xhQ

Can I make a career in freelancing as a Web developer?  It is compulsory to learn back-end development or only frontend is okay for freelancing? Someone said clients, companies want overall skillful people who knows back-end and front-end development, that's why I'm asking it.

Everyone is learning web development, all the front end developers have made gigs, there is saturation on the freelancing platform, so how to survive, how will anyone give work to the new ones?  

And can we do this for lifetime, can we secure it by making a career or will we have to do a job?? 
You know anything can happen when go online, ( what if) all your business shut down suddenly... What if YouTube, website or social media shut down, we already experienced that, now we often see social media shuts down occasionally.
So can you make career in all these field if you're drop out and can't find your career???

Also here is my question: üëáüèª
1. How to take it as business? 
2. How to find clients? 
3. What to do when you're sick or on vacation, traveling, how to handle clients then?
4. How to scale your business?Or you need to do job or any other income source for survival? 
5. After learning one skill you need to learn another skill for freelancing?
6. How to choose skill? I'm confused in 3-4 skills/careers like web development, graphics designer, thumbnail designer and animation, illustration etc which is better for long term career?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wckbRo6gDVk

Ok, maybe it's ocassionally (or sometimes) (or often) (or alot of times) poorly designed ad-hoc legacy data, but often that's characterized by lots of flat tables, redundantly scattered around.

Quick background on this course: I first launched this last November, and unfortunately, shortly after that, a plug-in that I used for the course (i.e., Noteable) was deprecated, causing me to pause enrollment for the course while I fixed it. Additionally, this entire course was behind a paywall, and I‚Äôll be honest, I didn‚Äôt feel right keeping video content from my subscribers. So I felt like this was a sign and instead decided to make the entire course public after I upgraded the course for the deprecated plug-in issues. So, I want to thank those who support the course by buying the course notes and certificate; without y‚Äôall, future tutorials wouldn‚Äôt be possible. ‚úå

FAQ
===
Q: How do I enable 'Advanced Data Analysis', it's not in Settings under ""Beta Features""?
A: 18:30 ADA is no longer included under this section and is auto included in the most advanced model.

Q: Does this require a ChatGPT subscription?
A: Yes, you‚Äôll need a Plus or Enterprise subscription to unlock the full potential of ChatGPT. The free version of ChatGPT is not powerful enough for this course.

Q: Do I need to know how to code to take this course?
A: No prior coding or analytical experience is required! This is for data professionals who want to automate finding data insights. 

Q: What are the computer requirements?
A: You only need a functioning laptop, desktop, or tablet with an internet connection; we‚Äôll access everything through a web browser, from ChatGPT to the course material.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhyMqbZI6rM

So what Im trying to tell is you actually state that portfolio projects are the key aspects that can provide alternate solution to lack of work experience, but in reality all my rejection were stated that they are impressed with portfolio projects but that doesn‚Äôt equalise the work experience. Despite of having 1 year of employment history in the industry along with another 1 and half years with building self projects Im facing rejections kind of this and mostly these opportunities were actually I was receiving from my same location (Chennai) and which recruiters they them self shown called me by seeing my profile on naukri and many applications that is applied were rejected straightly through the system. So I would like to know which is true, your channel states freshers can have chances in Data Analytics career but in my story every Hiring managers provide me rejection with a feedback that they required experienced candidates with real work experience projects not with the portfolio thing kindly provide guidance on this topic :)

While there will always some level of anxiety related to doing a job interview, you'll find its greatly reduced if you have experience in the domain, tools, and technology associated with the role. This doesn't have to be exclusively work experience. It can be hours of SQL practice or several projects using Python. Employers are looking for people that can help them get work done. And if you have a lot of work you got done, you can come in with confidence that you will be someone of value to the company. Do not neglect this part. Get in the practice on tools and tech you will use, finish projects in the domain and industry you want to work in, and shamelessly post about it somewhere!

I remember when I started my career, even I wasn‚Äôt entirely clear about the distinction. Back then, I thought both were just fancy terms for working with data, but I quickly realized how different the roles are and how much each contributes uniquely to solving problems.

This video is such a fantastic breakdown of these two disciplines. I loved how it highlighted that data analytics focuses on finding insights and answering specific questions, while data science is about building models and uncovering patterns for predictive insights. It‚Äôs a nuanced distinction that can be confusing, especially for newcomers, but this explanation really hit the mark.

For me, it was during my first project in data science that the difference truly clicked. I was building a machine learning model to predict customer churn while my colleague, an analyst, was digging into the historical data to understand why churn was happening in the first place. Both tasks were critical, but they required completely different approaches, tools, and ways of thinking. This kind of collaboration is what makes the data world so fascinating to me.

To anyone watching this video and trying to decide between these paths: think about whether you enjoy diving deep into datasets to find actionable insights (data analytics) or if you‚Äôd rather experiment with algorithms, code, and predictive models (data science). Either way, both fields are incredibly rewarding, and videos like this are great for helping you find your direction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcXqhMqhZUo

  - Data science and data analytics are often confused but serve different purposes.
  - Data science encompasses tasks like data mining, machine learning model training, and AI deployment.
  - Data analytics is a specialized field within data science focusing on querying, interpreting, and visualizing datasets.

- [00:01:47] üîÑ Data Science Lifecycle

  - The data science lifecycle consists of seven phases: problem identification, data mining, data cleaning, data exploration analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and data visualization.
  - It's an iterative process where hypotheses are formed and tested with data.
  - Essential skills for data scientists include proficiency in Python, R, big data platforms (like Hadoop or Apache Spark), and SQL.

- [00:03:30] üìà Types of Data Analytics

  - Data analytics involves various types: predictive, prescriptive, diagnostic, and descriptive analytics.
  - Predictive analytics forecasts trends and outcomes, while prescriptive analytics provides decision recommendations.
  - Diagnostic analytics identifies causes of events, and descriptive analytics evaluates data qualities and quantities.

- [00:05:16] üßÆ Skills for Data Analysts

  - Data analysts focus on interpreting existing data to derive actionable insights.
  - Skills required include analytical thinking, programming (especially in statistical tools), database familiarity, and data visualization.
  - Unlike data scientists, data analysts are less involved in creating new algorithms but rather in interpreting and applying data findings effectively.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcXqhMqhZUo

Also what about a finer or more subtle and nuanced consideration of smaller components on this problem. I saw at least two subcomponents. 1) Identify spam bot accounts. 2) Identify spam posts.

This differentiation is important. Not all spam posts are from spam bot accounts. And which was the goal? Was it to purge spam bot accts or to manage spam posts, or both?

lastly, what about front end implementation? What types of tools can the data science team that can help non-data scientists inspect specific posts? Or specific accounts? Huge opportunity to create user friend with tools that will help manage for example ... what about a tool that lets community manager click on a specific post and then see a dashboard of statistics and information about that post and about its account?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD468LfeVdc

Not just with reCaptcha-style and two-factor requirements but live-post monitoring and throttling as no human should need to post content more than 5 times per hour (imo).  As a data scientist this would have struck much quicker at solving the problem and perhaps mitigate the spam bot problem adequately to not need to implement this reactive solution in the first place.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sD468LfeVdc

The critical t-value for this scenario is approximately 2.045

In addition at 37:30 the sum of xi (-) x-bar is backwards. If you put that where 3199.6 is then you get the right slope. Putting this here just in case anybody was confused :)

00:45 *üöÄ La ciencia de datos es un campo en auge con t√©rminos como inteligencia artificial, aprendizaje autom√°tico y an√°lisis de datos en constante crecimiento.*
02:17 *üìä La definici√≥n de un cient√≠fico de datos var√≠a, pero a menudo se considera como alguien con habilidades en estad√≠stica, ingenier√≠a de software y conocimiento del dominio.*
04:20 *üõ∞Ô∏è En JPL, los cient√≠ficos de datos construyen herramientas para detectar anomal√≠as en el hardware espacial, utilizando algoritmos para analizar grandes cantidades de datos generados por los sat√©lites.*
05:42 *ü§î Los cient√≠ficos de datos trabajan con algoritmos, seleccionando y ajustando aquellos que mejor se adapten a los datos y al problema espec√≠fico que est√°n abordando.*
07:21 *üí° Un aspecto crucial de la ciencia de datos es la capacidad de convertir problemas humanos en problemas computacionales para su resoluci√≥n.*
08:32 *üîÑ Los cient√≠ficos de datos automatizan tareas y procesos, pero tambi√©n deben comunicar sus ideas de manera efectiva, utilizando un lenguaje accesible para el p√∫blico no t√©cnico.*
10:33 *üîç El cuidado de los datos es fundamental, desde la b√∫squeda y limpieza de datos hasta la comprensi√≥n de su estructura y la presentaci√≥n de los resultados de manera convincente.*
12:42 *üåê La colaboraci√≥n y el intercambio de conocimientos son parte integral de la ciencia de datos, con el c√≥digo abierto y la comunidad de c√≥digo abierto desempe√±ando un papel importante en la difusi√≥n de las soluciones y los avances.*
14:19 *üéì No se necesita necesariamente un t√≠tulo en ciencias de la computaci√≥n o matem√°ticas para ser un cient√≠fico de datos; personas de diversos campos pueden aplicar sus habilidades para resolver problemas utilizando datos y computadoras.*

So what Im trying to tell is you actually state that portfolio projects are the key aspects that can provide alternate solution to lack of work experience, but in reality all my rejection were stated that they are impressed with portfolio projects but that doesn‚Äôt equalise the work experience. Despite of having 1 year of employment history in the industry along with another 1 and half years with building self projects Im facing rejections kind of this and mostly these opportunities were actually I was receiving from my same location (Chennai) and which recruiters they them self shown called me by seeing my profile on naukri and many applications that is applied were rejected straightly through the system. So I would like to know which is true, your channel states freshers can have chances in Data Analytics career but in my story every Hiring managers provide me rejection with a feedback that they required experienced candidates with real work experience projects not with the portfolio thing kindly provide guidance on this topic :)

American here and im annoyed at the joke my current administration is making of the value of data. Specifically blaming DEI hires for the tragedy near the Potomac River. It doesnt take a genius to examine the applicant data and come to a conclusion about what metrics were used to hire an applicant. Of course this would need to be done for each position. Im sure there is a database of this information but that fascist pathetic excuse of a president will reject reason. I feel bad for DA in the federal government.

So what Im trying to tell is you actually state that portfolio projects are the key aspects that can provide alternate solution to lack of work experience, but in reality all my rejection were stated that they are impressed with portfolio projects but that doesn‚Äôt equalise the work experience. Despite of having 1 year of employment history in the industry along with another 1 and half years with building self projects Im facing rejections kind of this and mostly these opportunities were actually I was receiving from my same location (Chennai) and which recruiters they them self shown called me by seeing my profile on naukri and many applications that is applied were rejected straightly through the system. So I would like to know which is true, your channel states freshers can have chances in Data Analytics career but in my story every Hiring managers provide me rejection with a feedback that they required experienced candidates with real work experience projects not with the portfolio thing kindly provide guidance on this topic :)

While there will always some level of anxiety related to doing a job interview, you'll find its greatly reduced if you have experience in the domain, tools, and technology associated with the role. This doesn't have to be exclusively work experience. It can be hours of SQL practice or several projects using Python. Employers are looking for people that can help them get work done. And if you have a lot of work you got done, you can come in with confidence that you will be someone of value to the company. Do not neglect this part. Get in the practice on tools and tech you will use, finish projects in the domain and industry you want to work in, and shamelessly post about it somewhere!

I remember when I started my career, even I wasn‚Äôt entirely clear about the distinction. Back then, I thought both were just fancy terms for working with data, but I quickly realized how different the roles are and how much each contributes uniquely to solving problems.

This video is such a fantastic breakdown of these two disciplines. I loved how it highlighted that data analytics focuses on finding insights and answering specific questions, while data science is about building models and uncovering patterns for predictive insights. It‚Äôs a nuanced distinction that can be confusing, especially for newcomers, but this explanation really hit the mark.

For me, it was during my first project in data science that the difference truly clicked. I was building a machine learning model to predict customer churn while my colleague, an analyst, was digging into the historical data to understand why churn was happening in the first place. Both tasks were critical, but they required completely different approaches, tools, and ways of thinking. This kind of collaboration is what makes the data world so fascinating to me.

To anyone watching this video and trying to decide between these paths: think about whether you enjoy diving deep into datasets to find actionable insights (data analytics) or if you‚Äôd rather experiment with algorithms, code, and predictive models (data science). Either way, both fields are incredibly rewarding, and videos like this are great for helping you find your direction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcXqhMqhZUo

  - Data science and data analytics are often confused but serve different purposes.
  - Data science encompasses tasks like data mining, machine learning model training, and AI deployment.
  - Data analytics is a specialized field within data science focusing on querying, interpreting, and visualizing datasets.

- [00:01:47] üîÑ Data Science Lifecycle

  - The data science lifecycle consists of seven phases: problem identification, data mining, data cleaning, data exploration analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and data visualization.
  - It's an iterative process where hypotheses are formed and tested with data.
  - Essential skills for data scientists include proficiency in Python, R, big data platforms (like Hadoop or Apache Spark), and SQL.

- [00:03:30] üìà Types of Data Analytics

  - Data analytics involves various types: predictive, prescriptive, diagnostic, and descriptive analytics.
  - Predictive analytics forecasts trends and outcomes, while prescriptive analytics provides decision recommendations.
  - Diagnostic analytics identifies causes of events, and descriptive analytics evaluates data qualities and quantities.

- [00:05:16] üßÆ Skills for Data Analysts

  - Data analysts focus on interpreting existing data to derive actionable insights.
  - Skills required include analytical thinking, programming (especially in statistical tools), database familiarity, and data visualization.
  - Unlike data scientists, data analysts are less involved in creating new algorithms but rather in interpreting and applying data findings effectively.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcXqhMqhZUo

I am planning on earning my master's degree in some computer science field but am overwhelmed with the various fields and subfields and how they all relate.  (I have a Bachelor's degree that is NOT in computer science but the universities keep saying that I don't have to start all over but I can take certain required courses before enrolling in the graduate degree program)  I really need a helicopter's view of the entire field.

The critical t-value for this scenario is approximately 2.045

00:45 *üöÄ La ciencia de datos es un campo en auge con t√©rminos como inteligencia artificial, aprendizaje autom√°tico y an√°lisis de datos en constante crecimiento.*
02:17 *üìä La definici√≥n de un cient√≠fico de datos var√≠a, pero a menudo se considera como alguien con habilidades en estad√≠stica, ingenier√≠a de software y conocimiento del dominio.*
04:20 *üõ∞Ô∏è En JPL, los cient√≠ficos de datos construyen herramientas para detectar anomal√≠as en el hardware espacial, utilizando algoritmos para analizar grandes cantidades de datos generados por los sat√©lites.*
05:42 *ü§î Los cient√≠ficos de datos trabajan con algoritmos, seleccionando y ajustando aquellos que mejor se adapten a los datos y al problema espec√≠fico que est√°n abordando.*
07:21 *üí° Un aspecto crucial de la ciencia de datos es la capacidad de convertir problemas humanos en problemas computacionales para su resoluci√≥n.*
08:32 *üîÑ Los cient√≠ficos de datos automatizan tareas y procesos, pero tambi√©n deben comunicar sus ideas de manera efectiva, utilizando un lenguaje accesible para el p√∫blico no t√©cnico.*
10:33 *üîç El cuidado de los datos es fundamental, desde la b√∫squeda y limpieza de datos hasta la comprensi√≥n de su estructura y la presentaci√≥n de los resultados de manera convincente.*
12:42 *üåê La colaboraci√≥n y el intercambio de conocimientos son parte integral de la ciencia de datos, con el c√≥digo abierto y la comunidad de c√≥digo abierto desempe√±ando un papel importante en la difusi√≥n de las soluciones y los avances.*
14:19 *üéì No se necesita necesariamente un t√≠tulo en ciencias de la computaci√≥n o matem√°ticas para ser un cient√≠fico de datos; personas de diversos campos pueden aplicar sus habilidades para resolver problemas utilizando datos y computadoras.*
